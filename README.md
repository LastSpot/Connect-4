# Connect 4 Game

A classic two-player connection game where players take turns dropping colored discs into a vertical grid. The objective is to be the first player to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four discs of their color.

## Game Description

Connect 4 is a strategic game that combines simple rules with complex tactics. Players alternate turns dropping their colored discs (traditionally red and yellow) into one of seven columns. The disc falls to the lowest available position in the chosen column. The game continues until either:

- A player wins by connecting four discs in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally)
- The board fills up completely, resulting in a draw
- A player resigns

## Features

- Interactive game board with visual feedback
- Turn-based gameplay for two players
